This documentation is an almagamation of my knowledge and experiences, to hopefully provide myself and others with reference material for their jobs and hobbies.

Each doc may or may not contain personal notes that may appear on other resources on the internet, I will do my best to reference any and all source material that I use.

## Navigating the Wiki

I took my layout and information from this documentation idea, https://documentation.divio.com/introduction/.

- Tutorials are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind.
- How-to guides take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem.
- Reference guides are technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it. Reference guides have one job only: to describe.
  
## How the site works

- The website is stored within a GitHub Repo, this is then copied over to a Static Web App hosted in Azure using a GitHub action.
- The site is generated using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), big shout to them for making this incredible beast!
